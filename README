This is an MSP430 emulator plugin module for IDA Pro 6.4 and 6.5.

INSTALLATION:

Copy the appropriate modules for IDA 6.4 of IDA 6.5 and your platform
into your <IDA>/plugins directory, where <IDA> is the base directory
of your IDA install.

RUNNING:

After loading your MSP430 binary in IDA, activate the plugin via the 
Edit/Plugins menu (or Alt-F5 on Windows). The plugin will attempt
to read the reset vector at set the initial PC value accordingly.
Make sure that PC is pointing where you want it before you start
stepping through code.

The emulator was developed primarily for use in solving the challenges
at https://microcorruption.com/ so many aspects of the emulator are
specific to the platform used to host those challenges.

Two menu options of note are available on the Emulate menu. These options
allow you to ask the emulator to a) break on every system call, and b) 
emulate the bugs that are present in the microcorruption emualtor. IF YOU
ARE USING THE EMULATOR TO HELP ANALYZE THE MICROCORRUPTION CHALLENGES MAKE
SURE THAT YOU ENABLE THE MICROCORRUPTION BUGS OPTION.
